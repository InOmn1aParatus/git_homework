My first takeaway is that as long as I am able to effectively use Google or a coding resource site like Stack Overflow, I can get myself unstuck with most if not all problems encountered during Mod 0.
My second takeaway is that developing the muscle memory for completing simple tasks in the Terminal is as valuable in my novice stage as understanding the 'big picture' is in my proficient stage.

One strategy I plan to use throughout the rest of Mod 0 is that of utilizing coding drills for simple procedures to make complex tasks easier by way of consistent practice of the fundamentals.
Another strategy I plan to use is to commit to at least 20 minutes of personal research into a problem using the resources at my disposal before relying on guidance from instructors or peers at Turing.

I would like to give a shoutout to my good friend, John. John is a senior graphics programmer at Rockstar Games and has been a fantastic resource for guidance and troubleshooting when I was stuck on coding problems. Thanks, John! You're the best.

Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair
